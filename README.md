# AutoGate animated jetway and docking guidance system kit

This kit allows [X-Plane](https://www.x-plane.com/) scenery designers to add animated jetways and docking guidance systems (DGS) to scenery packages. Two types of jetway and four types of DGS are included.
 
The jetway animates to dock with the plane's main door when the pilot shuts down the plane's engines with the plane within Â½m of the correct stopping position. The DGS guides the pilot to the correct stopping position.

An example scenery package that uses these boarding bridges and DGSs can be found [here](http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/tutorials.html#autogate).
